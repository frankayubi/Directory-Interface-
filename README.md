# Directory-Interface 
Prompt the user for a directory name, verify that the directory exists, and navigate into that directory. If the directory does not exist, allow the user to create it.
List all the files and subdirectories in the directory and display a menu to the user to select a file or a subdirectory.

If a file is selected:
Display the first ten lines of the file.
Ask the user if they want to display more. If "yes", display the next ten lines.
Continue this process until the user responds with "no" or the end of the file is
reached.

 Perform a recursive search to find all files that have been modified in the last 24
hours.
Present a list of these files to the user and ask them to select one.
For the selected file, repeat the file display process as described in
